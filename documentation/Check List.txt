Mission Makers check list
=========================
Develop your mission concept around the follow:
Who - pick your factions
Where - look for an area of the map that will best suit your mission idea
When - choose an appropriate time of day for your mission and load outs.  No one likes a pitch black mission without NVGs.
Why - develop a basic background for why your mission is taking place
What - have an idea on what the end conditions are for your mission, think objectives and failure states


=========================
Step 1:
Use the TFD_mission_start_composition to automatically create all required units and other modules and respawn marker (ensure respawn marker is called "respawn")
By default the "respawn" marker is first marker that uses the GrenadeStop functionality which prevents players from shooting, grenading or otherwise being asshats with their weapons.  Mission designers can place further markers and define the radius if desired.


Step 2:
Use Eden arsenal to equip your soldiers as desired


Step 3:
Update the fn_setradio.sqf with the labels for your squads and the player slot numbers that are in each squad.  
This is also where you define what short range channel the squad will be on when the mission starts.



Step 4:
In Eden use the attributes menu to define your overview, loading image and mission name. Don't forget to define mission author for credit.
Also update the required fields in the Multiplayer attributes menu (player number and game type - don't touch the respawn settings!)


Step 5:
Update intro.sqf as required paying attention to the comments.  If you wish to disable the intro screen talk to Imp who will explain how (it's not as simple as just stopping intro.sqf, there are references to it elsewhere)


Step 6 (Optional):
If desired use the attributes menu of 3den Enhanced to define group insignia as defined in description.ext.  This allows you to place custom insignia if desired.


Step 7 (Optional):
Adjust TFAR.sqf where necessary.  Pay careful attention to the comments; no one likes broken radios!  This is where you define the default radio items/backpacks issued at mission start unless you equip them specifically via arsenal.


Step 8 (optional):
Configure your DAC zones.  Once tested ensure that map markers are turned off via dac_config_creator.sqf
Generally aim for no more than 90-120 units for a full scale mission.  Unit numbers will vary based on map used and the size of the area in which the mission will take place.


Step 9 (optional):
Define a casualty cap in the init.sqf


Step 10:
Update your briefing.sqf making sure to properly explain each component.  Execution can be used to help assist mission commanders in developing a plan of attack.  If you desire your mission to be approached in a certain manner then mention it in Execution.
Remember to be thorough in your briefing!!!


Step 11:
Change Werthless Headless Client array to disable debug mode.  Read comments and adjust the 3rd and 7th variables in the array to "false".


Step 12:
Thoroughly test the shit out of your mission on a full blown dedicated server environment with Headless Client active.  If possible have other players help you test out the mission.
